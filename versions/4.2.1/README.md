# Revive Adserver Docker Image
Revive Adserver Docker Image with the following features:
* Latest version: latest version of 4.2 and 5.0.
* Maintenance: maintenance script run via cron optionally.
* Memcached: built-in memcached server by default but optionally.
* PHP: PHP-FPM 7.4 with opcache enabled using image from https://github.com/Rp70/docker-php. So this image inherits flexiable environment variables from the PHP-FPM image.
* GeoIP auto update (comming soon).

# Development Status
Stable and works on production, but less document. I'll provide document and instructions when I get a chance. Please feel free to submit PRs.

# TODO
- [ ] Cloudflare IPs auto update.
- [ ] GeoIP auto update.
- [ ] Test cases.
